# Android Mobile App to test Resolution



The mobile app aims to test the resolution functionality of the remote service. Basically, the app
has two features: Scanning and resolving.
The user launches the app and he starts scanning for BLE beacons, specifically, EID format
beacons. The list of available beacons will appear dynamically on a list. The user may decide to
resolve a beacon with the web service if it is already registered. The server will send back a
Boolean response authenticating the beacon.
